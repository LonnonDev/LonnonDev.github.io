	<p>This is the second article of this entire website, who knows if this will ancient or not depending on how "succsessful" this website would or could be. Right now, as of 20/04/2021: 3 people know this. I don't know what else to really include within this article besides rambling in a formal tone and misspelled words everywhere as this is written on notepad without, y'know spellcheck and i'm too lazy. <p>
